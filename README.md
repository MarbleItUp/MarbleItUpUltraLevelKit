# Marble It Up! Ultra Level Kit

Indev version of the Marble It Up! Ultra level kit for Unity.

⚠ **This repo should never be made public!** ⚠ It has commit history containing potentially secretive shaders/scripts. When it is time to launch, we will copy the final project over to a new repo.

# Anatomy

The folders `MIU`, `MIU Internal`, and `MIU Level Assets` contain assets from MIUPrivateKit that have yet to be scrubbed/updated.

The folder `Marble It Up Ultra` contains assets that are ready to go, and will be used to create the final unity package.
